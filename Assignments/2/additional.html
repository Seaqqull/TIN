                    For many months now, our team at BioWare has been hard at work updating the textures, shaders, models, effects and technical features of three enormous games.
                    Our goal was not to remake or reimagine the original games, but to modernize the experience so that fans and new players can experience the original work in its best possible form.
                    It's been amazing to see the adventures of Commander Shepard take on new life in super-sharp resolution, faster framerates, and beautiful visual enhancements.
